========================

* Fix handling of Windows paths by replace all forward-slash instances
  with path.sep, and detecting the root directory for a path better.
* Removed support for creating multiple paths at once, as it doesn't
  really fit with what advanced-open-file is about and made the code
  harder to understand.
* Add `Ctrl-p`/`Ctrl-n` and `Ctrl-i`/`Ctrl-k` as alternative keybindings
  for moving through the file list, and use commands for all keybindings
  to make customization easier.

  shortcuts enabled did not automatically fill in the user's home
  directory.

* When scrolling with the keyboard, the list of matching files now
  scrolls to show the selected file when it is out of view.

  relative to the first project root. When relative paths are being used, the
  directory listing will not show a parent entry past the project root.
